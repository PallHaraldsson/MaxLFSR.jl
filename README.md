# MaxLFSR

A simple implementation of maximal length Linear Feedback Shift-Registers from 4 bits to 64 bits, allowing for fast generation of a pseudo-random permutation of the numbers `{1, 2, ..., N}` for any `N` from `1` to `2^64 - 1`.

The sole exported function from this package is

    LFSR(length; seed = 1)

which, constructs a maximum length shift register that will randomly cycle once through the numbers `1` to `length`. 
Keyword argument `seed` defines the starting point for the LFSR.

## Example
```julia
# Standard LFSR
julia> A = LFSR(10)
LFSR for 1:10 starting at 1

julia> for i in A
           println(i)
       end
1

# Change the starting location
julia> A = LFSR(10; seed = 7)
LFSR for 1:10 starting at 7

julia> for i in A
           println(i)
       end
7

```

## Implementation
The implementation attempts to be as efficient as possible.
To construct a LFSR for an arbitrary length, `MaxLFSR` will choose the minimum possible number of bits needed to encode that length.
During iteration, values generated by the underlying LFSR will be skipped.

Feedback terms were taken from <https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/lfsr/index.html>

## Testing Limitations
In theory, this package generates LFSRs up to 64 bits in length.
However, it is impossible to actually test sequences this long.
Hence, the test-suite only tests LFSRs up to a maximum length of 30 bits.
